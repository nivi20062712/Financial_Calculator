üßæ Project Overview
This Financial Calculator is a simple console-based C program designed to help users plan and analyze their personal finances. 
It allows users to:
- Split income into savings and expenses
- Plan investments in different asset classes (Mutual Funds, Gold, Equity, US Stocks)
- Calculate Future Value (Lump Sum) returns
- Calculate SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) returns with Future Value computation

This project demonstrates fundamental C programming concepts like:
- Conditional statements (if‚Äìelse, switch)
- User-defined functions
- Function declaration and call
- Global variables
- Loops and input/output
- Mathematical calculations using math.h

‚öôÔ∏è Features
 Financial Planner ‚Äì Automatically divides income into savings and expenses
 Custom Allocation ‚Äì Allocate savings into multiple investments
 Lump Sum Calculator ‚Äì Predicts future returns on one-time investments
 SIP Calculator ‚Äì Calculates total future value and profit based on monthly investments
 User-Friendly Interface ‚Äì Menu-driven program with clear instructions
 Educational Purpose ‚Äì Best suited for beginner-level CSE students

üß© Technical Details
Language: C
Compiler: Turbo C / GCC
Libraries Used:
- stdio.h ‚Äì for input/output
- math.h ‚Äì for power and financial calculations

üß† Learning Outcomes
From this project, you will learn:
- How to structure a C program using multiple functions
- How to implement mathematical formulas (Future Value, SIP formula)
- How to use modular programming and switch-case logic
- How to handle user input validation
- How to make console-based interactive programs

üìà Formulae Used
1Ô∏è‚É£ Future Value (Lump Sum):
FV = P √ó (1 + r)^t

where
- P = Principal amount
- r = Annual rate of return
- t = Time (in years)

2Ô∏è‚É£ SIP Future Value:
FV = P √ó ((1 + r)^n - 1) / r √ó (1 + r)

where
- P = Monthly investment
- r = Monthly rate of return (annual rate √∑ 12)
- n = Total months (years √ó 12)
